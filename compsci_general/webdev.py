Client
"""
"""ðŸ§  Think: 'The requester--show me a website.'"""
# The client is the user-facing part of an application.
# It sends requests to servers and displays the results.
# Runs in a browser, mobile app, or desktop app.
# Examples: Chrome, React app, iOS app, Postman

"""
Server
"""
"""ðŸ§  Think: 'The answerer â€” the one who receives and responds.'"""
# The server listens for client requests and sends back data or pages.
# Often includes business logic and connects to databases.
# Runs on a remote machine or cloud instance.
# Examples: Flask, Express, Django, FastAPI

"""
Service
"""
"""ðŸ§  Think: 'The specialist â€” focused on one job, callable by others.'"""
# A service performs a specific task, like authentication or payment.
# Can be part of a server or a separate microservice.
# Examples: Stripe API, Auth0, Email sending service

"""
Example Flow
"""
"""ðŸ§  Think: 'Client asks, Server responds, Service helps behind the scenes.'"""
# 1. Client â†’ sends HTTP request (GET /profile)
# 2. Server â†’ processes it, may call other services
# 3. Service â†’ does a job (e.g., fetch user data)
# 4. Server â†’ sends back response to client
# 5. Client â†’ renders the result for the user

ðŸ§ A hook is like a scheduled interruption: when X happens, do Y.
"""
# Hooks are functions that run automatically at specific moments in a lifecycle.
# Example: useEffect(() => {
#   console.log("Component mounted");
# }, []);... runs when component loads

# You give an app (e.g. Stripe, GitHub) a callback URL.
# That app sends a POST request to your URL when an event occurs.
# Your server handles it.
