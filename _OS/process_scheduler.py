# Notes:
# A queue is a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure â€” 
# like a at the amazon store, where the first person to get in line is the first served.

# pid = process identifier (name or number)
# burst = amount of CPU time required by the process
# priority = scheduling priority (not used here but important in other algorithms)
# round_robin simulates the CPU giving fixed time slices (quantum) to each process cyclically.
# If a process is not finished in one quantum, it goes back to the end of the queue.
