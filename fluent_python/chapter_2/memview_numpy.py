# memoryview: access and manipulate the binary data of objects 
# (like array, bytes, or bytearray) without copying it â€” you work with the 
# same memory buffer. It's useful for performance-critical tasks like binary 
# file parsing, image processing, or interfacing with C code

# this could be relevant for real-time data feeds, 
# fast parsing(wheather simulation), Sensor/device data (e.g., from solar inverters, smart meters)
# learn more what this is, means, and how to implement
